1. Load the data (RandomForest.py)
2. Explore a pattern: Calculating the percentage of female and male passengers (in train.csv) who survived
3. ML Model (RandomForest): The code looks for patterns in four different columns ("Pclass", "Sex", "SibSp", and "Parch") of the data. It constructs the trees in the random forest model based on patterns in the train.csv file, before generating predictions for the passengers in test.csv
